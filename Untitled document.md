# **Decentralized Real-Time Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDPS) Platform**

## **Abstract**

### This document presents the design and implementation of a scalable, privacy-focused, decentralized Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) leveraging lightweight machine learning models, plugin-based extensibility, and blockchain-enabled orchestration. The platform is optimized for real-time network traffic flow anomaly detection, allowing Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to collaboratively detect and respond to threats while preserving zero-trust security principles. The architecture is designed to evolve with integration of decentralized ledgers, vector databases, automated retraining, and rich visualization capabilities.

## **1\. Introduction**

### Network security increasingly demands real-time, adaptive defenses capable of detecting novel threats. Traditional signature-based detection methods lack the flexibility and speed needed for todayâ€™s dynamic environments. Anomaly-based IDPS, powered by machine learning, offers a promising approach to identify deviations from established baselines.

### This work proposes a novel system that balances model efficiency, extensibility, and decentralization to address modern security challenges. It allows multiple SOCs or SIEMs to interoperate in a decentralized, trustless environment, sharing threat intelligence while protecting privacy. The design anticipates future enhancements including decentralized ledger integration for node management and event sharing, richer contextual analysis via vector databases, and automated model retraining pipelines for adaptive security.

## **2\. System Overview**

### **2.1 Goals**

* ### **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:** Monitor network traffic in real-time to establish dynamic baselines and detect anomalies using lightweight ML models, with planned integration of real traffic ingestion and packet capture pipelines. 

* ### **Plugin-Based Extensibility:** Enable customizable, modular detection logic to accommodate diverse environments and evolving threats, supporting both internal and external third-party plugins. 

* ### **Decentralized Orchestration:** Facilitate multiple independent SOCs/SIEMs to collaborate securely through blockchain or distributed ledger technologies, forming immutable audit trails and trustless communication channels. 

* ### **Privacy and Zero Trust:** Enforce strict data privacy using encryption, external centralized key management, and cryptographic authentication. Data minimization principles ensure raw data remains local, with only anonymized or aggregated alerts shared. 

* ### **Service Offering:** Provide traffic flow anomaly detection as a service to clients, with flexible integration of internal or third-party models/APIs, alongside rich visualization dashboards and API gateways for multi-tenant management. 

* ### **Future-Proofing:** Designed with extensibility to incorporate automated model retraining, continuous integration pipelines, and scalable vector database backends for retrieval-augmented reasoning.

* ### Constructs aggregated prompts combining event tokens and retrieval context, feeding into the ML model for collective anomaly scoring. 

* ### Designed for horizontal scalability to handle increasing traffic volumes and complex reasoning workloads. 

### **3.3 Plugin Manager and Plugins**

* ### Manages plugin lifecycle (load, validate, reload, remove) with standardized metadata (`plugin.yaml`) and implementation (`main.py`). 

* ### Plugins encapsulate domain-specific heuristics, anomaly detection enhancements, or response triggers. 

* ### Enables SOCs or clients to customize detection logic dynamically, supporting continuous deployment without downtime. 

* ### Future support includes plugin marketplaces or sharing ecosystems to foster community-driven innovation.

## **4\. Data Flow and Operation**

1. ### **Event Generation:** Network traffic events are captured locally or simulated, tokenized for analysis. 

2. ### **Batch Processing:** Events are aggregated into batches to improve inference context and reduce overhead. 

3. ### **Contextual Retrieval:** Planned retrieval of related events or threat intelligence from vector databases enhances reasoning. 

4. ### **ML Inference:** Batch reasoning engine applies the lightweight model to the aggregated context to generate anomaly scores. 

5. ### **Plugin Execution:** Plugins run heuristics and rule-based detection on individual events for additional insight. 

6. ### **Alert Aggregation:** ML and plugin results are merged into structured alerts with metadata for downstream consumption. 

7. ### **Decentralized Sharing:** Alerts and metadata are securely broadcast across decentralized node networks using blockchain-backed authentication and communication. 

8. ### **Key Security:** All cryptographic operations are performed with keys managed by the centralized KMS to protect confidentiality and integrity.

## **6\. Security and Privacy Considerations**

* ### **Zero Trust Authentication:** Nodes authenticate mutually using cryptographic proofs; trust is continuously verified. 

* ### **Data Minimization:** Only aggregated and anonymized alert data is shared; raw traffic remains local unless explicitly authorized. 

* ### **Key Isolation:** Encryption keys are managed externally, never stored on nodes, preventing insider threats. 

* ### **Immutable Audit Trails:** Blockchain-based logging ensures tamper-proof records of node activity, registrations, and event histories. 

* ### **Secure Communications:** All inter-node communications employ strong encryption and integrity checks to prevent interception or tampering.
