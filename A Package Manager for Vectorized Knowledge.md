# 📘 RAGPack: A Package Manager for Vectorized Knowledge

## Overview
RAGPack is a proposed open format and command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing vectorized document knowledge used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Inspired by the ease of use of `pip` and `npm`, RAGPack enables developers to package, install, query, and share reusable knowledge modules as `.ragpack` archives.

---

## Motivation
Modern RAG pipelines suffer from redundancy and inefficiency:
- 🔁 Repeated embedding of the same documents across teams
- 🕸️ Reliance on brittle web scraping
- 📦 No standard format for sharing knowledge bases
- 🔐 Lack of provenance, licensing, and update mechanisms

RAGPack solves this by treating knowledge as a modular, installable asset — eliminating the need to constantly rebuild local vector stores.

## Core Concept

### What is a `.ragpack`?
A `.ragpack` is a zipped knowledge bundle containing:

```text
my-knowledge.ragpack
├── rag.json         # Metadata
├── chunks.jsonl     # Pre-chunked documents
├── embeddings.npy   # Embedding vectors
├── index.json       # Vector index (optional)
├── LICENSE          # Usage terms
└── README.md        # Description
```

These packs are model-agnostic, self-contained, and reusable.

---

## CLI Usage: `rag`

The `rag` CLI manages RAGPacks locally and remotely:

```bash
rag init                       # Start a new RAG project
rag embed ./docs              # Chunk and embed documents
rag pack ./myproject          # Build .ragpack file
rag install file.ragpack      # Install a local package
rag pull @org/topic           # (planned) Pull from registry
rag query "search string"      # (planned) Semantic search
```

---

## Registry Ecosystem

RAGPack supports both public and private knowledge registries:

| Registry             | Use Case                    |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| `raghub.io`          | Public open-source packs    |
| `ragcorp.internal`   | Enterprise private packs    |
| `rag.edu`            | Academic datasets           |

Each pack is versioned, signed, and license-compliant.

---

## File Spec: `rag.json`

```json
{
  "name": "@myorg/product-docs",
  "version": "0.3.1",
  "license": "MIT",
  "description": "Customer-facing API documentation",
  "embedding": { "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" },
  "chunking": { "method": "sliding_window" },
  "created_at": "2025-07-08"
}
```

---

## Roadmap

### ✅ 1. MVP CLI Tool
- `rag init`, `rag pack`, `rag install`

### 🧱 2. Embedding + Chunking Pipeline
- Support local doc embedding via standard models
- Save results as `chunks.jsonl` + `embeddings.npy`

### 🔍 3. Local Querying
- Run `rag query "prompt"`
- Return top-k semantically matched chunks

### 📦 4. Registry Hosting + Push/Pull
- Push/pull packs from centralized registry
- SHA integrity, optional GPG signatures

### 🔐 5. Digital Signing + License Compliance
- SPDX support, signature verification
- `LICENSES.txt` manifest for included content

## Benefits

| Benefit         | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ♻️ Reusable     | Share packs across teams and use cases      |
| 🧠 Model-agnostic | Use any local embedding model               |
| ⏱️ Time-saving   | Avoid repeated scraping and embedding       |
| 📜 Compliant     | Enforce license and origin transparency     |

## Sample Python Scaffold

```python
# rag_cli_tool.py (snippet)
import argparse
import json
from zipfile import ZipFile

# Commands: init, pack, install
# Future: embed, query, pull, push
```

---

## Conclusion
RAGPack introduces a modular, secure, and shareable way to build and deploy RAG systems. By treating knowledge like code dependencies, it accelerates prototyping, simplifies updates, and supports reproducible AI pipelines.
