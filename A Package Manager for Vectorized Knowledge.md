# 📄 RAGPack: A Package Manager for Vectorized Knowledge

## Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines have become essential for making large language models (LLMs) context-aware and up-to-date. However, developers still rely on ad hoc methods such as web scraping, manual document parsing, and redundant embedding computations. This white paper proposes a new system: **RAGPack**, a standardized format and CLI tool that allows users to package, install, version, and query vectorized knowledge packs — similar to how `pip` and `npm` manage code dependencies.

## Problem Statement

Modern RAG workflows face several bottlenecks:

- 🔍 **Web scraping** is brittle, slow, and legally questionable
- 📄 **Chunking and embedding** documents is redundant across projects
- 🔄 **No versioning** for knowledge bases or embeddings
- 🧱 **Lack of modularity** and reuse for preprocessed data


---

## Vision: pip-for-RAG

A system where knowledge is versioned, reusable, and can be installed like software packages.

```bash
rag install @wikipedia/climate-change
rag pull @arxiv/2025-08
rag query "transformer loss functions"
```

## What is a RAGPack?

A `.ragpack` is a zip archive that contains:

```text
my-ragpack.ragpack
├── rag.json           # Metadata
├── chunks.jsonl       # Text chunks
├── embeddings.npy     # Embedding matrix
├── index.json         # Mapping chunk_id -> vector index
├── LICENSE            # Usage rights
└── README.md          # Documentation
```

## Benefits

| Feature           | Description                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 📦 Reusability    | Embed once, reuse everywhere                 |
| 🔄 Updatability   | Pull the latest docs or deltas               |
| 🧠 Compatibility  | Works with any embedding model               |
| 🔐 Trust & Licenses| Know where your knowledge comes from        |

---

## CLI Tool: `rag`

### Basic Commands

```bash
rag init               # Scaffold new ragpack project
rag embed docs/        # (planned) Embed local documents
rag pack ./my-ragpack  # Create .ragpack archive
rag install file.ragpack # Install from local file
rag pull <name>        # (planned) Update from registry
rag query "text"       # (planned) Search embeddings
```

---

## Registry Design (Future Work)

Public and private registries will host `.ragpack`s:

| Registry Name      | Description                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| `raghub.io`        | Public open knowledge              |
| `ragcorp.internal` | Company private knowledge base     |
| `rag.edu`          | Academic datasets & research       |

---

## File Spec: `rag.json`

```json
{
  "name": "my-ragpack",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "My first RAG pack",
  "license": "CC-BY-4.0",
  "chunking": {"method": "sliding_window"},
  "embedding": {"model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"},
  "created_at": "2025-07-08",
  "maintainers": ["@you"]
}
```

---

### Commands Supported

- `rag init`
- `rag pack <folder>`
- `rag install <file>`

---

## Roadmap

1. ✅ MVP CLI tool
2. 🔜 Embedding + chunking pipeline
3. 🔜 Local querying
4. 🔜 Registry hosting + push/pull
5. 🔜 Digital signing + license compliance

---

## Conclusion

RAGPack bridges the gap between data preparation and production-grade RAG systems. With it, teams can stop rebuilding the same pipelines and start sharing clean, queryable knowledge just like code. It aims to become the package manager for knowledge itself.
