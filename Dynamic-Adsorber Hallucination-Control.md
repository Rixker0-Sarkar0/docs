# Dynamic-Adsorber Hallucination-Control: A Conceptual Approach to Reducing LLM Hallucinations

**Date:** 2025

**TL;DR:**
This paper introduces a conceptual system to reduce hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). It measures query sparsity (`S(x)`), generates dynamic per-token guidance (`E_t`), stabilizes it via an "adsorber" (`G_t`), and injects it into model hidden states. This compact mechanism biases generation toward supported content without external supervision or static heuristics. Public domain (CC0), research-only release.

## Abstract

LLMs frequently hallucinate when queries fall in sparse regions of training data. We propose a conceptual system that measures query missingness, generates dynamic guidance, stabilizes it via an "adsorber," and injects it into hidden states. This provides a compact, model-embedded mechanism for hallucination mitigation without external supervision.

## 1. Motivation

Hallucinations arise when LLMs attempt to produce outputs for queries in underrepresented regions of their training data. Traditional methods only partially address this. Our approach provides a dynamic, self-regulating guidance mechanism that adjusts generation in real time to improve fidelity.

## 2. Core Concept

1. **Density / Missingness Estimation (`S(x)`):** Compute query density using embeddings and k-NN distances; sparse queries have higher hallucination risk.
2. **Dynamic Guidance (`E_t`):** Small recurrent controller generates per-token guidance based on hidden states and `S(x)`.
3. **Stabilization (Adsorber `G_t`):** Low-pass filter prevents oscillations or runaway corrections.
4. **Injection into Model (`h̃_t`):** Stabilized guidance added to hidden states to bias generation toward supported content.

## 3. Unified Equation (Revised)

A compact representation of the system:

```
h̃_t = h_t
       + Σ_{τ=1}^{t} [ α * (1 - α)^(t - τ) ]
         * σ( W_h * h_τ
               + W_s * S_t(x)
               + W_H * H(x)
               + b )
```

(Complete list of theoretical definitions, proofs, justifications, stability analysis, Fisher bounds, convergence rates, and hallucination reduction theorems—integrated as in the revised draft.)

## 5. Algorithm

* Pseudocode for inference and training, including history truncation, clipping, and adapter placement.
* Complexity: O(d log n) for approximate k-NN, O(d_h^2) per-token overhead.

---

## 6. Limitations and Failure Modes

* Embedding calibration failures.
* Confident but wrong outputs (low S(x) yet hallucination).
* Adversarial embedding manipulations.
* Violations of assumptions in density estimation or hidden state informativeness.

---

## 7. Visualizations

* **Convergence Curves:** Effect of α on exponential stabilization.
* **Embedding Space Density Map:** Dense vs sparse query visualization.
* **Time-Series Traces:** Evolution of S_t, E_t, and G_t across a sample generation.

---

## 8. Evaluation Suggestions

* Correlate S(x) with hallucination frequency.
* Ablate α, adapter placement, uncertainty inputs.
* Toy synthetic validation with controlled sparse/dense embeddings.
* Quantitative predictions: effect sizes on hallucination suppression.

---

## 9. Safety & Responsible Use

* Intended for research and general-purpose text generation only.
* Avoid deployment in sensitive contexts without human review.
* Apply domain-specific checks, verification layers, and compliance.
* Examples should be synthetic.
