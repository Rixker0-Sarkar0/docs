# Dynamic-Adsorber Hallucination-Control: A Conceptual Approach to Reducing LLM Hallucinations

**Date:** 2025

**TL;DR:**  
This paper introduces a conceptual system to reduce hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). It measures query sparsity (`S(x)`), generates dynamic per-token guidance (`E_t`), stabilizes it via an "adsorber" (`G_t`), and injects it into model hidden states. This compact mechanism biases generation toward supported content without external supervision or static heuristics. Public domain (CC0), research-only release.

## Abstract
LLMs frequently hallucinate when queries fall in sparse regions of training data. We propose a conceptual system that measures query missingness, generates dynamic guidance, stabilizes it via an "adsorber," and injects it into hidden states. This provides a compact, model-embedded mechanism for hallucination mitigation without external supervision.

---

## 1. Motivation
Hallucinations arise when LLMs attempt to produce outputs for queries in underrepresented regions of their training data. Traditional methods only partially address this. Our approach provides a dynamic, self-regulating guidance mechanism that adjusts generation in real time to improve fidelity.

---

## 2. Core Concept
1. **Density / Missingness Estimation (`S(x)`):** Compute query density using embeddings and k-NN distances; sparse queries have higher hallucination risk.  
2. **Dynamic Guidance (`E_t`):** Small recurrent controller generates per-token guidance based on hidden states and `S(x)`.  
3. **Stabilization (Adsorber `G_t`):** Low-pass filter prevents oscillations or runaway corrections.  
4. **Injection into Model (`h̃_t`):** Stabilized guidance added to hidden states to bias generation toward supported content.

## 3. Unified Equation

A compact representation of the system:

h̃_t = h_t + sum_{τ=1}^{t} α * (1 - α)^(t - τ) * σ( W_h * h_τ + W_s * S(x) + W_H * H(x) + b )

Where:  
- h_t = hidden state at token t  
- S(x) = missingness / density score  
- H(x) = optional per-token entropy / uncertainty  
- E_t = dynamic guidance output  
- G_t = stabilized guidance (adsorber)  
- α = damping / low-pass coefficient

## 5. Implementation Notes
- Guidance controller can be a small recurrent perceptron or adapter module.  
- `S(x)` computed locally via embeddings and k-NN search.  
- Stabilization prevents drift; α tunable empirically.  
- Optional: distill dynamic guidance into a static function for efficiency.

---

## 6. Evaluation Suggestions
- Correlate `S(x)` with hallucination frequency.  
- Ablate adapter: on/off, α, r_dim, hidden layer placement.  
- Test robustness with synthetic adversarial prompts.  
- Track false-refusal vs hallucination suppression.

---

## 7. Safety & Responsible Use
- Intended for research and general-purpose text generation only.  
- Avoid deploying in contexts where hallucinations could cause harm without verification.  
- Apply domain-specific checks, human review, and regulatory compliance.  
- All examples should be synthetic or generic.
