# ReconMem: A Dynamic Heuristics-Powered Reconnaissance Intelligence Pipeline

## Abstract
**ReconMem** is a modular and scalable intelligence pipeline tailored for cybersecurity practitioners, red teams, and AI-enhanced penetration testers. It combines traditional pattern-matching heuristics with modern LLM capabilities to create a dynamic, evolving recon engine capable of learning, syncing, and adapting from field data and insights.

## Introduction
Modern recon tools are often static, relying on hardcoded patterns and manual signal review. ReconMem transforms recon workflows into live intelligence systems. It builds a memory layer by continuously updating heuristics, tagging unseen signals, and distributing intelligence across tools and deployments.

## Problem Statement
Traditional recon workflows suffer from:

- **Static regex lists**
- **Non-versioned logic**
- **Manual intelligence loops**
- **Over-reliance on one-off toolchains**

Field testing in air-gapped or semi-offline environments makes it difficult to rely on central AI infrastructure. Moreover, hallucinations from LLMs must be interpreted and constrained for actionable output.

## Architecture Overview
The pipeline includes:

### 1. Raw Ingestion Layer
- HTML, JS, JSON API, and config scrapes
- PDF and DOCX recon data
- VLM-parsed diagrams (optional)

### 2. Heuristics Matcher
Using a central YAML or JSON heuristics map:

```yaml
- name: jwt_token
  pattern: "eyJ[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\\.[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\\.[A-Za-z0-9-_]+"
  tags: ["auth", "token"]
  confidence: high
```

Patterns are pulled from local and remote GitHub syncs.

### 3. LLM Insight Layer
Used for unmatched data and novel detections. Supports:

- Tag suggestions
- Prompt generation
- Vulnerability predictions

Heuristic promotion is gated by regex verification or analyst review.

### 4. Human Review + Promotion
Promotes hallucinated patterns into validated heuristics via GitHub PR, increasing accuracy over time.

### 5. Cloud Sync
- GitHub-based heuristic YAML feed
- CI pull/update
- Optional live push from agents

## Intelligence Loop
```
Raw Data ➜ Heuristics ➜ LLM Insight ➜ Review ➜ Sync
```

## External Sync Support
- `PayloadsAllTheThings`
- CVE-derived heuristic scrapers
- GitHub-hosted regex maps

## Advantages
| Feature                    | Benefit                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Cloud-hosted heuristics   | Centralized versioning & free sync           |
| LLM-enhanced discovery    | Dynamic insight from recon outputs           |
| Regex-backed matching     | Speed and interpretability                   |
| Modular architecture      | Extend or replace components easily          |
| Human-in-the-loop         | Reduces hallucination risk                   |

## Deployment Scenarios
- CI pipelines
- Air-gapped red team kits
- Security vendor integrations
- Academic threat modeling

## Conclusion
ReconMem builds a continuously evolving recon engine, combining pattern-based precision with LLM-driven generalization. It supports distributed intelligence sharing without needing central GPU-heavy servers.
